This repository contains the lecture notes and exams (with solutions) for an upper level undergraduate course on number theory which I taught in Spring 2011. The course covered much of the very nice book [Number Fields](http://www.amazon.com/Number-Fields-Universitext-Daniel-Marcus/dp/0387902791) by Daniel Marcus.

The topics covered:
* discriminants
* ramification of primes
* decomposition and inertia groups
* quadratic reciprocity
* [Minkowski's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski%27s_theorem) on the geometry of numbers
* Dirichlet's theorem that the unit group is finitely generated
* distribution of ideals in the ring of integers of a number field
* class number formula
